My name is Jonas Samuelsson. I'm a software developer living in Ã–rebro, Sweden.

I love developing software, open souce and thinking about software practices & processes.

I'm working at [CAB](http://www.cab.se), as an architect/developer.

In my spare time I'm currently wrapping my head around ASP.NET MVC, Web API, SignalR and RavenDB.
